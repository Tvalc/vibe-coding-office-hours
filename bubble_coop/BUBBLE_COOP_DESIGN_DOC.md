# BUBBLE COOP - DESIGN DOCUMENT

## Game Concept
"Bubble Coop" is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game where the main character, Coop, uses a bubble gun to capture enemies. Players can toggle between "capture mode" and "destroy mode" to either collect enemies or immediately destroy them for resources. 

In capture mode, enemies are stored in the player's inventory (initially limited to 1 slot, expandable up to 50 with upgrades). When the inventory reaches maximum capacity, the game automatically switches to destroy mode until space is freed up. Players can manually discard captured enemies from their inventory to make room for new captures.

Captured enemies can either be converted into followers or destroyed to collect XP and currency. These resources are used to level up Coop, expand inventory capacity, and enhance any followers acquired through bubble conversion.

### Bubble Gun Mechanics
- Fires bubbles that can capture enemies when they make contact
- Captured enemies float in bubbles for a limited time before breaking free
- Players must decide quickly whether to convert or destroy captured enemies

### Conversion System
- **Convert:** Turn enemies into followers who fight alongside Coop
- **Destroy:** Burst the bubble to defeat the enemy and collect XP and currency
- Different enemy types offer different advantages as followers

### Progression System

- **Currency:** Used to upgrade bubble gun, abilities, and follower capacity
- **Enemy Inventory:** Initially limited to 1 captured enemy, expands with level progression up to 50 slots
- **Capture/Destroy Mode:** Toggle between capturing enemies (storing in inventory) or destroying them for immediate resources
- Leveling up unlocks new abilities, increases stats, and expands inventory capacity

  window.FarcadeSDK.singlePlayer.actions.hapticFeedback();
  ```

### Event Listeners
- **Play Again:**
  ```javascript
  window.FarcadeSDK.on('play_again', () => {
    // Reset the game state here
