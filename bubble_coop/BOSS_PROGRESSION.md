# BUBBLE COOP - BOSS PROGRESSION

## Nemesis System: Park & Blockchain Bosses

Each level in Bubble Coop will feature a two-phase boss encounter:
1. Sub-boss fight against Park (your brainwashed former friend)
2. Main boss fight against a blockchain-themed entity

After completing level 10, Park will have a revelation, break free from the brainwashing, and join your team as a powerful ally.

## Park Character Profile

**Name:** Park
**Role:** Recurring Nemesis â†’ Ally (after Level 10)
**Appearance:** Sleek, corporate-styled character with glowing digital accents that gradually change from hostile red to friendly blue over the course of the game
**Weapon:** Reverse Bubble Gun (absorbs your bubbles and can use them against you)

**Background Story:**
Park was Coop's best friend and bubble research partner before being captured and brainwashed by the blockchain conglomerate. Now he fights to stop Coop, unaware that he's being manipulated. With each encounter, fragments of his true memories surface, until he finally breaks free after the 10th battle.

**Nemesis Progression:**
1. Each time Park is defeated, he retreats rather than being captured
2. After each defeat, his dialogue shows increasing signs of internal conflict
3. His abilities evolve with each encounter, learning from previous defeats
4. Visual cues (color scheme shifting from red to purple to blue) hint at his gradual recovery

## Level 10 Special Event: Park's Redemption

After defeating the Blockchain boss in level 10, a special cutscene triggers:

```json
"specialEvents": {
  "parkRedemption": {
    "trigger": "after_boss_defeat",
    "dialogues": [
      {
        "character": "park",

        "portrait": "park_awakening.png"
      },
      {
        "character": "coop",
        "text": "Park! You're back! I knew you were still in there somewhere.",
        "portrait": "coop_relieved.png"
      },
      {
        "character": "park",
        "text": "The control device... it's broken. I'm free, thanks to you.",
        "portrait": "park_device_broken.png",
        "animation": "park_removes_device"
      },
      {

        "portrait": "park_serious.png"
      },
      {
        "character": "park",
        "text": "I know their weak points now. Let me join you - together we can stop them!",
        "portrait": "park_determined.png"

      "abilities": ["bubble_resonance", "counter_protocol", "digital_insight"]
    },
    "showTutorial": "park_abilities"
  }
}
```

## Park Ally Implementation

When Park joins as an ally after level 10, he has unique implementation as a special follower:

```javascript
// Park follower creation in the FollowerFactory
createParkFollower() {
    const entity = this.entityManager.create(['follower', 'special', 'park']);
    
    // Add standard components
    entity.addComponent(new BubbleCoop.TransformComponent(0, 0));
    entity.addComponent(new BubbleCoop.SpriteComponent(
        'park_ally', 60, 80, 0, 0
    ));
    
    // Add animations
    const animComponent = new BubbleCoop.AnimationComponent();
    animComponent.addAnimation('idle', ['park_ally_idle_1', 'park_ally_idle_2', 'park_ally_idle_3', 'park_ally_idle_4'], 0.15);
    animComponent.addAnimation('run', ['park_ally_run_1', 'park_ally_run_2', 'park_ally_run_3', 'park_ally_run_4', 'park_ally_run_5', 'park_ally_run_6'], 0.1);
    animComponent.addAnimation('bubble_attack', ['park_ally_attack_1', 'park_ally_attack_2', 'park_ally_attack_3', 'park_ally_attack_4', 'park_ally_attack_5'], 0.08);
    entity.addComponent(animComponent);
    
    // Add special follower component
    const parkFollower = new BubbleCoop.ParkFollowerComponent();
    entity.addComponent(parkFollower);
    
    // Add Park's unique abilities
    entity.addComponent(new BubbleCoop.BubbleResonanceComponent());
    entity.addComponent(new BubbleCoop.CounterProtocolComponent());
    entity.addComponent(new BubbleCoop.DigitalInsightComponent());
    
    return entity;
}
```

```javascript
// Park's special follower component
BubbleCoop.ParkFollowerComponent = class extends BubbleCoop.FollowerComponent {
    constructor() {
        super('park');
        
        // Park starts at level 5
        this.level = 5;
        this.xpToNextLevel = 500;
        
        // Special positioning
        this.targetOffset = { x: -30, y: 0 }; // Stays closer to player than regular followers
        
        // Special ability - Synchronized Bubble Blast
        this.syncedBubbleReady = false;
        this.syncedBubbleCooldown = 30; // seconds
        this.syncedBubbleCooldownTimer = 0;
    }
    
    update(dt) {
        super.update(dt);
        
        // Update synced bubble cooldown
        if (!this.syncedBubbleReady) {
            this.syncedBubbleCooldownTimer += dt;
            if (this.syncedBubbleCooldownTimer >= this.syncedBubbleCooldown) {
                this.syncedBubbleReady = true;
                
                // Notify player
                BubbleCoop.EventBus.publish('synced_bubble_ready', {});
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Special ability implementation
    activateSyncedBubbleBlast() {
        if (!this.syncedBubbleReady) return false;
        
        this.syncedBubbleReady = false;
        this.syncedBubbleCooldownTimer = 0;
        
        // Create the synced bubble blast effect
        // This is a massive AoE attack that damages all enemies on screen
        return true;
    }
};
```

By incorporating Park as a recurring nemesis and redemption character, along with themed blockchain bosses, Bubble Coop gains a compelling narrative arc that enhances the gameplay progression while maintaining the core bubble mechanics.
