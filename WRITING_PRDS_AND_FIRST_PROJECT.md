# Writing PRDs and Your First Project

## 1. Crafting & Refining a Product Design Document (PRD)

**Why a PRD?**  
A PRD helps you clarify your ideas, set goals, and keep everyone on the same page.

**Steps:**
1. Start a new markdown file: `PRD.md`
2. Include these sections:
   - **Project Overview:** What are you building?
   - **Goals & Non-Goals:** What do you want to achieve? What’s out of scope?
   - **User Stories:** Who is it for? What can they do?
   - **Features:** List and describe core features.
   - **Timeline/Milestones:** What’s the plan?
3. Share your PRD with the group for feedback and iteration.

**Example:**  
See the PRD for Glitter Cloud Adventure or TLAGD for inspiration.
